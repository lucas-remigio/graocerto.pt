# 💰 Grão Certo - A Modern Full-Stack Financial Management Platform

Portugal faces significant challenges in financial literacy, ranking among the lowest in Europe according to OECD studies. Many Portuguese families struggle with:

- **Low financial awareness** - Limited understanding of personal finance fundamentals
- **Poor spending visibility** - Lack of tools to track where money actually goes
- **Budget management gaps** - Difficulty knowing how much remains at month's end
- **Cultural barriers** - Financial planning not being part of everyday conversations

While numerous expense tracking solutions exist globally, this project tackles the **root cause** with a **Portuguese-first approach**, focusing on being the **fastest**, **most secure**, and **aesthetically pleasing** platform specifically designed for Portuguese users.

**Why Another Expense Tracker?**

- ⚡ **Performance-First**: Sub-second load times and lightning-fast interactions
- 🔒 **Security-Focused**: Enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication and encrypted data
- 🎨 **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface that makes financial tracking enjoyable
- 🇵🇹 **Portuguese-Centric**: Built specifically for Portuguese financial behaviors and cultural context
- 🤝 **Community-Driven**: Open to feature requests and changes to ensure everyone feels comfortable using the platform

Before you can improve your finances, you need to understand your spending patterns, identify cost-cutting opportunities, and gain visibility into your monthly cash flow.
